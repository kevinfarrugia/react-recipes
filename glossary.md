# Glossary

The glossary explains some common React jargon in simpler terms.

#### ancestor component

See [component, ancestor](#component-ancestor).

#### Babel

#### callback function

See [function, callback](#function-callback).

#### child component

See [component, child](#component-child).

#### class component

See [component, class](#component-class).

#### descendant component

See [component, descendant](#component-descendant).

#### comparison, deep

#### comparison, shallow

#### component

#### component, ancestor

We say that a component is an _ancestor_ of another component if it's higher up the [component tree](#component-tree). A direct ancestor is usually called a [parent](#component-parent) component. 

The reverse of an ancestor is called a [descendant](#component-descendant). A direct descendant is called a [child](#component-child).

```jsx
<A>
  <B>
    <C/>
  </B>
</A>
```

In the example above, `A` is an ancestor of `C`; conversely, `C` is a descendant of `A`.

In React parents and children communicate via [props](#prop). Ancestors and descendants can use the [context](#context) API to communicate direcly without having to pass props down the component tree from parent to child.

#### component, child

In React parents and children communicate via [props](#prop).

#### component, class

#### component, descendant

We say that a component is a _descendant_ of another component if it's lower down the [component tree](#component-tree). A direct descendant is usually called a [child](#component-child) component. 

The reverse of an descendant is called an [ancestor](#component-ancestor). A direct ancestor is called a [parent](#component-parent).

```jsx
<A>
  <B>
    <C/>
  </B>
</A>
```

In the example above, `C` is an descendant of `A`; conversely, `A` is an ancestor of `C`.

In React parents and children communicate via [props](#prop). Ancestors and descendants can use the [context](#context) API to communicate direcly without having to pass props down the component tree from parent to child.

#### merge, shallow

_Merging_ means combining two or more objects. It usually involves a _source_ object and a _destination_ object.

A _shallow merge_ is takes the properties from the source object and copies them over to the _destination_ object, adding to it any new properties and _overwriting_ existing properties with new values.

```js
const source = {
  name: 'New Name',
  address: {
    city: 'Bucharest'
  },
  birthdate: '01/01/1911'
};

const destination = {
  name: 'Old Name',
  address: {
    city: "Cluj-Napoca",
    street: "Museum Square"
  },
  occupation: 'freelancer'
};

shallowMerge(destination, source);

/* => 
{
  name: 'New Name',
  address: {
    city: 'Bucharest'
  },
  occupation: 'freelancer'
}
 */
```

In the example above, the _destination_ object:

* gets a new value for the existing string property `name`;
* gets an entirely new object for the existing object property `address`;
* gets a new property `birthdate`;
* retains its value for the property `occupation`.

It's called a _shallow_ merge because it doesn't merge nested properties; instead it overwrites them altogheter (in the example, the `address` property gets overwritten). A merge that also applies to nested properties is called a [deep merge](#merge-deep).

A React component's `setState(newState)` method _shallowly merges_ `newState` into the component's existing [state](#state-react), so you only need to send the properties you want to change to it.

#### merge, deep

_Merging_ means combining two or more objects. It usually involves a _source_ object and a _destination_ object.

A _deep merge_ is takes the properties from the source object and copies them over to the _destination_ object, adding to it any new properties and _merging_ the old values of existing properties with the new values.

```js
const source = {
  name: 'New Name',
  address: {
    city: 'Bucharest'
  },
  birthdate: '01/01/1911'
};

const destination = {
  name: 'Old Name',
  address: {
    city: "Cluj-Napoca",
    street: "Museum Square"
  },
  occupation: 'freelancer'
};

deepMerge(destination, source);

/* => 
{
  name: 'New Name',
  address: {
    city: 'Bucharest',
    street: "Museum Square"
  },
  occupation: 'freelancer'
}
 */
```

In the example above, the _destination_ object:

* gets a new value for the existing string property `name`;
* gets a value for the existing object property `address` that merges existing value and the new value;
* gets a new property `birthdate`;
* retains its value for the property `occupation`.

It's called a _deep_ merge because also _merges_ nested properties instead of overwriting them altogether as in the case of a [shallow merge](#merge-shallow).

A React component's `setState(newState)` method __does not__ deeply merge `newState` into the component's existing [state](#state-react) (instead, it does so [shallowly](#merge-shallow)). Use [a variant of the `setState` function](./recipes/set-state.md) that allows you to build the new state out based on the existing one to update a nested property:

```js
this.setState(
  previous_state => {
    return {
      address: {
        ...previous_state.address,
        city: 'Bucharest'
      }
    }
  }
)
```

The example above updates the nested `address.city` property of the state.
